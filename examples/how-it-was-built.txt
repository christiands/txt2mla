!TITLE: txt2mla: A Study of Preference
!CONTENT:
	Software is a product of necessity. Every tool we build has some convenience
factor to it. Even entertainment applications, like video games, make it easy
for users to explore new worlds in real time, of their own imagination, without
the effort to create it themselves. txt2mla is one of these programs. I wrote it
in order to be able to write my essays in a medium I prefer, rather than using
a specified program. The program just automates the usual conversion of copy and
paste.

	You may be thinking to yourself, "Why not just do it yourself?". Well, the
computer can do it better, and faster. Humans make mistakes. I usually lose
points because my MLA format sucks. By making the computer do the nitpicky work
for me, I can focus my time on more important things, like perfecting my essay,
or sleeping.

	Of course, to get these savings, I have to write the program. This is your
up-front investment. But once you make the investment, then you never have to
again (most of the time). I invest my time this summer to improve my experience
in the fall.
